      # client and server to negotiate a graceful teardown of an idle persistent connection. Therefore, it can happen that a server decides to
      # close a connection at the same time that a client decides to send a new request. In that case, the request will fail to be processed,
      # but the client cannot determine for which reason the server closed the connection and whether the request was (partly) processed or not.

      # "Connection reset by peer".
