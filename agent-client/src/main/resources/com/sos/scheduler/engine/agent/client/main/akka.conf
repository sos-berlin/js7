      #    currently busy with earlier requests it has to be queued until a
      #    connection becomes available.
      # 2. With pipelining enabled:
      #    The request timeout timer starts only once the response for the
      #    preceding request on the connection has arrived.
      # Set to `infinite` to completely disable request timeouts.
